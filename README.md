                         The custom port for the neo4j container
  -wp WEB-PORT, --web-port WEB-PORT
                         The custom port for the web container (default: 8080)

### Example

```
python3 bloodhound-automation.py -z ~/Documents/20230907105804_BloodHound.zip -P Thisisverysecure-1 -np 7687
```

## Customization options

You can customize the Docker file located in the templates folder for further modifications.

By default, the script initializes three containers. Once the execution completes, you can shut down both the web and the PostgreSQL containers if you only want to keep the Neo4j instance running.

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker-compose

Make sure you have both Docker and Docker-compose installed on your system for the script to work effectively.
